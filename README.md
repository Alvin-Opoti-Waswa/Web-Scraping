# WEB SCRAPING
I am creating a database by extracting html elements from a webpage.
## The Modules Used:
Urllib.request -> The urllib.request module, which is a part of Python's standard library. Is used to make HTTP requests to web pages
BeautifulSoup -> We import the BeautifulSoup class from the bs4 (Beautiful Soup 4) library. This class is the main tool we'll use for parsing HTML.
Regex -> We import Python's built-in re module, which stands for Regular Expressions. Regular expressions are a powerful tool for searching and manipulating strings.
Pandas -> Lastly we import the pandas library and assigns it the alias pd. pandas is a powerful data manipulation and analysis library in Python.
## In Summary:
We use these import statements set up the basic tools we'll need for web scraping: fetching web pages (urllib.request), parsing HTML (BeautifulSoup), handling regular expressions (re), and data manipulation (pandas).
